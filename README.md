# Footwear Retailer Product Listings Page

### This is a Product Listings Page (PLP) for a footwear retailer, deployed [here](https://footwear-b7it.onrender.com). I created this for a software company that offers an ecommerce platform for retailers.

## 1. Client brief

I was asked to write functionality and styling to:

- Lay out all products in a responsive product grid
- Create a filter toggle that shows only available products
- Create a brand filter that shows only toggled brand products
- Add a counter for the number of resulting products
- Create a dropdown to sort all products into ascending or descending price order
- Add an option to sort all products by relevance - with all available products shown first in ascending rank order, then all unavailable products in ascending rank order.

## 2. Installation

_Clone this repo and run the following commands in your terminal._

```
npm install
```

```
npm run serve
```

```
npm run build
```

## 3. Functionality

Users can:

- View all products rendered in a responsive product grid
- Filter the grid to show only products that are in stock
- Filter the grid to show only products belonging to a particular brand
- See a counter representing the number of resulting products
- Sort all products into ascending or descending price order from a dropdown menu
- Sort all products by relevance from a dropdown menu
